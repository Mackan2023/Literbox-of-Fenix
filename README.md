# literbox Fenix

Hey, I have an idea, if you like to "bug" with, well, go head.
I'm totally new to programming/electrical/ect, I'm no one,
I will need a lot of help if you are interested in helping me? you are welcome to help.

I have no idea what I'm doing here or what is what but I have an idea that I really like to do.

it is a self-cleaning litter box for cats,

2, stepper motor -> a driver
1, optical reader
2, HX711 weight sensor
1, Blue Pill, STM32F103C8T6

it should be fun to do something I'm not good at :)

about me:
I'm not an electrician/programmer/etc/ sometimes it's hard to understand.


1 - firmware <first step to take with stm32f1>.
2 - Id√© or worth to make it in software.
3 - main.py <start from main.py read from 4-startup ?>
